# Immediate Values
Immediate Values(or operands) in an Instruction are used to present a Value
<br>
They are encoded in a way to represent them
<br><br>

## Representing Immediate Values
First we need to have some info about binary and hex

Binary is used by the computer to present values since it cant represent decimal and it is base 2

Hex is the Shortened Version of binary and it is base 16

You can google stuff about Integer to Binary and Binary to Hex

So if we have the value **10**
<br>
and in binary it is in **1011**
<br>
which in hex is **A**
<br><br>
Most Computers can store 8 bits(byte) pet memory address
so we add other four 0s 
<br><br>
So now we have 
<br>
**00001011**(binary)
<br>
**0A**(hex)
<br>
<br>
So now we have our immediate value :D
